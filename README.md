•       The standard Infrastructure Agent commands (install, uninstall, start, stop, restart, status, clean_uninstall, force_start, force_stop, restart)
•       Configure Infrastructure Agent properties
•       Configure the Infrastructure Agent extensions property
•       Install and configure Host Monitoring
