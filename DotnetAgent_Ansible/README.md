Ansible is an open source software automation platform that lets you deploy, manage, and operate applications remotely and agentlessly using industry-standard SSH or PowerShell connections. You can use Ansible to deploy the Dotnet Agent and to automate Dotnet Agent-related tasks on multiple hosts simultaneously. The following tasks are supported:
1. The standard Dotnet Agent commands (install, uninstall, start_IIS, stop_IIS, restart_IIS)
2. Generate a report for the performed operations
